# Todo Manager Sprint 4

## Problem Statement

Todo Manager is an application, which can manage our Tasks and keep track of our Tasks. In
the course of 3 week, we will be creating a Todo manager.

## User Stories:-

1. As a user, I should be able to register and login to the application.
2. As a user, I can be Client or a Visitor.
3. As a client I should be able to add the task into an array
4. As a client I should be able to update the task in the array
5. As a client I should be able to delete the task in the array
6. As a client I should be able to search a task from an array
7. As a Visitor, I should be able to see the task assigned to me

## Instructions:-

1. Please refactor the code created in sprint 3.
2. Please use arrays to store the user objects
3. All the CRUD operations should happen in a dao class. Main should contain only
menu
4. The application can be exited only if user enters 0 to exit. Else, user should see the
menu repeatedly.
5. Visitors are not supposed to register themselves.
6. Only Client will register the visitor





Special Instructions:
Client must be registered first, then he can add task, once tasks are added then he can create accounts for Visitors and the task is assigned
to the registered visitor, then Client log-out from the system, then visitor logs-in, then he should see the task assigned to the logged-in visitor...
